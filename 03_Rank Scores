# In SQL, the DENSE_RANK() function is used to assign a rank to each distinct row within a result set. 
# Unlike the RANK() function, DENSE_RANK() does not leave gaps in the ranking when there are tied values. 
# If two or more rows have the same values and receive the same rank, the next rank is incremented by the number of tied rows.


select score, dense_rank() over(order by score desc) as "rank"
